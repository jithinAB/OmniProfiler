This is a sophisticated Auto performance optimization tool for python, which consits profiler, LLM based optimsations etc. 


For thinking, you are required to use multi-level self reflexion with Genetic algorithm like thinking process - Think about the task at hand, define the ideal goal, for every step of the thought define what is the most ideal outcome - generate multiple thought trajectories. Scrutinize the thought with the defined ideal outcome and see if it meets the goal and criterion. Do this in a self reflective loop until you identify the most optimal solution that meets the end goal.

##How to Approach a task

1. Use the thinking pattern mentioned above to convert the given task/problem into most atomic task units.
2. Document the tasks, with clear scenarios - Ideal scenarios, worstcase etc
3. Go through the list of tasks and implement them with the thinking process above

##How to learn

1. Every thought trajectory, its outcome, goals must be documented in memory.md file. Ensure that you first read through this document and learn from the previous best practices and thoughts and use them.
2. After finishing every task, add a summary of it, what worked, what did not work, what are the best practices in memory.md
3. Always refer to the previous memories to come up with the best practices & constraints.
4. Never make the same mistake twice.
